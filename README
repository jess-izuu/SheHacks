Have you ever wondered about the relationship between cooking time and weight of certain foods? 
How does the temperature change as a function of time and distance from the center? 
And how does the temperature differ for different shapes that occupy various volumes as they heat? 
Or why, on a cold day, is getting out of the shower and standing on the carpet warmer than stepping onto the tile when both the tile and carpet hold the same temperature? 

The answers lie in the everyday phenomena known as Thermodynamics, the basic principles of science that dictate how energy is 
transferred from one object to another. There are 3 modes of heat transfer: conduction, convection, and radiation, and all 3 
describe how we and the molecules all around us interact with each other. These 3 methods are not always independent and 
sometimes, all 3 methods of heat transfer are present! 

The governing differential equation of Unsteady State Heat Transfer describes how temperature changes with location & time through a surface. 

  dT/dt = alpha*(d/dr)*(r(n)*(dT/dr))
  
  where
  alpha: thermal coefficient 
  n = 1: cylinder (tenderloin)
  V = pi*r^2*h
  V = m/density
  
  n = 2: sphere (turkey) 
  V = 4/3 * pi * r^3 
  V = m/density
  
  T: temperature
  t: time
  r: radius 
  
  Since the Volume of both a sphere and a cylinder can be expressed in terms of radius and weight, we can solve for the temperature
  as a function of distance from the center and with respect to time. 
  
  Using the pdepe function to solve this differential equation, we concluded through statistical analysis that weight and cooking
  time do not have a linear relationship as claimed by the packaging for both meats. Our model also shows that the cook time for the
  tenderloin is actually more and that the turkey is less than instructed on the packaging labels.
