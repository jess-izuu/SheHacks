Have you ever wondered about the relationship between cooking time and weight of certain foods? 
How does the temperature change as a function of time and distance from the center? 
And how does the temperature differ for different shapes that occupy various volumes as they heat? 
Or why, on a cold day, is getting out of the shower and standing on the carpet warmer than stepping onto the tile when both the tile and carpet hold the same temperature? 

The answers lie in the everyday phenomena known as Thermodynamics, the basic principles of science that dictate how energy is transferred from one object to another. There are 3 modes of heat transfer: conduction, convection, and radiation, and all 3 describe how we and the molecules all around us interact with each other. These 3 methods are not always independent and sometimes, all 3 methods of heat transfer are present!
